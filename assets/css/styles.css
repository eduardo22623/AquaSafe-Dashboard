// Initialize Supabase
const supabaseUrl='https://jysmjqjqjqjqjqjqjqj.supabase.co'; // REPLACE WITH REAL URL FROM PREVIOUS CONFIG OR LEAVE UNTIL USER PROVIDES
// Wait, I need the real URL and Key. I see them in the previous file reads?
// I don't see .env content (Step 9 listed it but didn't read it).
// I should read .env from _legacy or water_quality_iot.tsx (Step 30) imported from './lib/supabaseClient'.
// Let's check if I can find the key in the code I read.
// water_quality_iot.tsx imported `supabase` from `./lib/supabaseClient`. I didn't read `lib/supabaseClient.ts`.
// I should try to read `_legacy/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` (or .js/tsx) to get the credentials.
// Or read `_legacy/.env`.

// I will place placeholders or try to read it in the next step.
// For now I will write a placeholder file or try to read `.env` with a separate tool call if I haven't closed this one.
// I can't do tool calls inside write_to_file content generation.

// I will write this file with placeholders for now, and update it immediately after reading the config.
// Better: I will read the config FIRST, then write this file.
// So I will skip writing supabaseClient.js for this turn and read the legacy file.

// ACTUALLY, I am in the tool call generation block. I must commit or change plan.
// I will write `styles.css` ONLY in this turn, then read the config, then write the JS files.

// Just Styles for now.
